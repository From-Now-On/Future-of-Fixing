=//The Future of Fixing//, an exhibition and programme about attitudes to repair. Make your own version.= 
This wiki is an open source exhibition: all materials are freely available for anyone to download and make their own version.

This exhibition was originally curated by [[@https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcharny/|Daniel Charny]] and produced by [[@http://www.fromnowon.co.uk|From Now On]] and produced in partnership with the [[@http://lodzdesign.com/en/the-world-to-fix/|Łódź Design Festival ]]and [[@http://design.britishcouncil.org/projects/maker-library/|British Council ADF]]. It was called Brave Fixed World and was also part of the British Council's [[@http://makerlibrarynetwork.org/|Maker Library Network]]. Shown during October 2014 it was a highlight in a festival that attracted over 45,000 visitors. With the support of our partners, we're now releasing the content under a Creative Commons Licence.

=What is it? Why should I host one?= 

//The Future of Fixing// is an exhibition and programme that inspires people to start making and fixing again. Inspiring, adaptable and multiform - it's a cultural add-on for makerspaces and community spaces wanting to strengthen their critical offer. By hosting your own, you'll invite your local community to think about what they own and what they make. By sharing you will add your voice to a wider conversation about the role of making in our future.

=What do I need to do to make it happen?= 
===1: FIND A SPACE=== 
Whether you run a makerspace, work at a library, or would like to draw more people to your studio, you can make this format work for you. The Future of Fixing is really flexible and can be adapted at pretty much any scale. You do however need some kind of space - whether it's a shelf, a corner, a room or a floor of a disused bank.

===2: DECIDE ON A FORMULA=== 
The first version of the Future of Fixing had [[Components|multiple components]] - you might only be interested in 1 or 2.
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you run a makerspace, why not focus on the library and gallery?</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">If this is for your studio, you could also exhibit someone else's inspiring work.</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you run a quiet space, shake it up with a hands-on programme.</span>
Check the [[Components|components]] from the original version of the exhibition and visit '[[Decide on a formula|Decide on a Formula']] to help you think it through.

===3: PLAN YOUR PROGRAMME=== 
This is where it gets serious. Depending on the scale of your ambition you'll need to go through a sequence of steps:
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Research and source your content</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Curate and design your space</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Create your programme</span>
To make this easier we've made a [[file:Future of Fixing - PLANNER.pdf|planner]] and explained how we approached it on the [[Plan your programme]] page. You'll have your own needs and priorities but these might serve as a good base for you.

===4. MAKE IT HAPPEN!=== 
It's your show now - we can't tell you how to do it and can't do it for you. But we think all you need is right here in this Wiki - we're sharing many of the tools we've developed along the years and materials you'll need including all of our original materials from <span class="s1">Łódź</span> Design Festival, from exhibit lists and interpretive texts to graphics and work plans. We're even sharing the links to the drawings that were used to build the displays (a tested system designed by Alon Meron and shared under Creative Commons licenses). Browse the [[Tools and materials]] page, take what you want to use and adapt to your particular circumstance. Good luck!
This project is under a creative commons licence - so all we ask in return is that you share your new content under the same licence and that you credit us. Don't panic - it's all explained on the [[Network|Network page]]!
