# Future-of-Fixing
The Future of Fixing is an open source exhibition and program that promotes engagement with making and repair. Seeing fixing as a creative mindset, it is a call for integrating fixing in our day to day life and for reflecting on attitudes to fixing in the future. The Future of Fixing was created by From-Now-On in 2014.
