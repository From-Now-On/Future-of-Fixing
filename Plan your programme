=PLAN YOUR PROGRAMME= 

Once you've outlined your 'formula' you can start to think about the work you need to do in order to make it happen. You might not have done anything like this before - in which case our main advice is keep it simple! Some of the materials and language here can make things seem complex. They don't have to be. Most of the work described below could be simple and short if well managed, and even the biggest and most ambitious projects could benefit from keeping this rule in mind.

We've pulled these steps together on this planner, which you can use initially to plan out the work and later as a checklist.

**Step 1: Find a space**
Gather your people. As we already mentioned.

**Step 2: Decide on a formula**
You've done this by now right?

**Step 3: Research and source your content**
We call this part 'making sense', you can call it what you want.
You can check our original selection, see how we arranged it into clusters, and make your own version.
Be open minded about what makes for interesting content. We had blue tack as an exhibited in ours and it work very well.
Check our [[file:FUTURE OF FIXING 1.0 - Indicative Exhibits List.pdf|exhibits list ]]in the '[[Tools and materials|Tools and Materials]]' page to see what we showed.

===**Step 4. Curate, design and install your space**=== 
Depending on which pack you'll go for, you can choose to be more or less ambitious with the set up.
There are many great open source exhibition designs online. You can also use what's readily available around you.
We've also provided you with our captions and templates so you can make your own.
Check '[[Tools and materials|Tools and Materials]]' to see what's available.

===Step 5: Create your programme=== 
Talks, workshops and gallery tours are all great ways to draw people in and meet interesting makers.
Depending on how long your exhibition will run, you can host events on a regular basis, or organise a main gathering.
A good programme brings the space to life, and even allows the transmission of skills.
Check '[[file:FUTURE OF FIXING 1.0 Indicative Programme from Brave Fixed World.pdf|Programme]]' for ideas.

===**STEP 6: INVITE PEOPLE TO COME AND LET US KNOW!**=== 
Now that you're all set, share the word! You can tweet using the #FutureOfFixing, #BraveFixedWorld and #TheFutureNeedsFixing
Log yourself onto the '[[Network]]' page once you're up.
